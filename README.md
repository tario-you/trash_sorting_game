# Trash Sorting Game

This project was designed and executed for the China Thinks Big (CTB) competition, an initiative with the aim of promoting social well-being and improving the quality of life in China through local action.

Our primary achievement was the implementation of the first-ever E-Waste Curriculum. We organized an extensive collection drive, successfully amassing 280kg of e-waste. In addition, we spread awareness about this subject and our project with the school's faculty and staff, setting up informative assemblies to further extend our initiative's reach. Over the course of the project, we were able to educate over 350 students and 50 teachers about the importance and process of e-waste management.

A crucial component of the E-Waste Curriculum was an interactive game, designed and developed by our team. The main objective of this educational tool was to teach students about waste segregation, with a specific focus on e-waste. Through an engaging and user-friendly interface, the game serves as an efficient medium to educate the younger generation about the critical role they can play in waste management and environmental conservation.
